<br />

Hi there, my name is Febriana and I am a front-end enthusiast who is passionate about creating user-friendly web experiences. In addition to my technical skills, I have a range of soft skills that make me a competitive and collaborative team member.

One of my greatest strengths is my ability to actively listen and communicate effectively. I believe that effective communication is key to achieving success in any team setting. By actively listening to my colleagues and understanding their perspectives, I can work collaboratively to achieve our goals.

In addition, I am a collaborative team member who values teamwork and diversity. I believe that every member of a team brings a unique set of skills and perspectives that can contribute to the success of a project. By encouraging diversity and inclusivity, I have seen firsthand how teams can overcome obstacles and create incredible products that make a positive impact.

In summary, I am always eager to learn new things and take on new challenges, and I look forward to contributing to the success of any team I am a part of. Thank you for taking the time to read my Github profile, and I am excited to connect with like-minded professionals in the field of front-end development!
